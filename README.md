# Data_Synchronization
 The Real-time Data Synchronization System for Hospital Records Management is designed to facilitate seamless and secure communication between hospital staff and their data. The system employs a real-time synchronization mechanism to ensure that data updates made on the server are immediately propagated to all connected clients. This project focuses on developing a robust architecture that can accommodate both MySQL and MongoDB databases, providing flexibility in data storage. The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express.js, with Socket.IO enabling real-time bidirectional communication. The front end is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap for responsive design.
